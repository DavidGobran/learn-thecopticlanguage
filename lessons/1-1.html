      <div class="bodyText">Welcome to the Coptic Language Cirriculum! A few things before we start: Firstly, text highlighted in <vocab>Blue</vocab> is a vocab word. Many of these will appear in quizzes after the lesson, so keep an eye out for them while you are reading! Secondly, there are words highlighted in <coptic id="grey">grei</coptic>. These are Coptic words, and you can hear their pronunciation if you click on them. Lastly, there are source embeds that show sections of the Liturgical services for reference. Here's an example: </div> 
 <div class="copticView">
      <div class="cvHeader">Introduction to the Midnight Praises</div>
      <div class="cvContent">
        <div class="english">Arise, O you children of the light: let us praise the Lord of hosts</div>
        
        <div class="coptic">Teny/nou e~p~swi nis/ri n~te piouwini n~tenhwc e~Po#c# n~te nijom.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
      <div class="bodyText">Ok, now for the first lesson. As an Egyptian language, we can see how this language has evolved from its much older counterparts, including Hieroglyphics, from Ancient Egypt. The Coptic script took many letters from the Greek alphabet as well, using only 6 of the original <vocab>Demotic</vocab>, or ancient Egyptian letters, to supplement the phonetics (sounds) missing in the Greek language. As Coptic grew in different parts of Egypt, it also formed various <vocab>dialects</vocab>, or regional variants, of the Coptic language. The dialect of Coptic that is used in the Coptic Orthodox Church is called <vocab>Bohairic</vocab>, although other common dialects include <vocab>Sahidic</vocab> and <vocab>Fayyumic</vocab> (click <a href="https://apps.lib.umich.edu/online-exhibits/exhibits/show/coptic-manuscripts/coptic-dialects" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about dialects). The Coptic Orthodox Church is one of the main places where the Coptic language has been preserved, and is the primary scope of this course. May God bless your learning and I hope you enjoy the course!
